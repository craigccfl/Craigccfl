      <title>Carnivore Eating</title>

      <description>The ultimate way to eat zero carb. Most people end up on a carnivore diet by going through a process, they generally start out with Paleo then move to low-carb high-fat (LCHF) then many of us spend time doing the ketogenic diet. Usually, just out of curiosity, some of us move into a carnivore diet. IMO, it never hurts to try something for a couple months just to see how you feel (N=1).</description>

      <description>Reducing saturated fats as suggested by our USDA, is very bad advice. They got it all wrong when they started promoting vegetable oils to replace saturated fats. Conventional wisdom suggests eating polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oils are healthier for our heart, despite interventional studies dating back to the 60s proving this advice is misleading. We consume more PUFAs today, yet the metabolic health of our society is rapidly declining each decade.</description>

      <title>Learn how to burn fat, keeping it simple (KIS)</title>

      <description>Dr. Ken Berry, &amp;ldquo;Suffering from Dunlaps disease, follow these instructions.&amp;rdquo; What&amp;rsquo;s Dunlaps disease? It&amp;rsquo;s when the belly done lops over the belt holding up your pants. Coming to the realization this site has a lot of postings debunking mainstream nutritional guidance and not much instruction written in keep it simple (KIS) format, decided to post something different called, Simple steps for becoming fat adapted. The reason for this specific guidance is based on N=1 and what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and heard thousands of others accomplish by taking some of these steps.</description>

      <description>Our nutritional needs have not changed. Scientist are aware of the fact, species cannot have a large digestive system and a large brain. There is only so much energy to distribute, it either goes to the brain or to the digestive system. Animals either need a large stomach and intestine to extract energy from low caloric plant foods or have an increase in intelligence from eating dense nutrient bioavailable foods usually derived from consuming animals.</description>

      <description>This is a technical paper for those who have delved into some of the scientific discussions regarding over activation of human growth hormone and its relationship with long-term health. The consensuses (beliefs) states over activation of metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), creates excessive cellular oxidation leading to atherosclerosis, and diets high in choline (meat) cause over activation of TMAO. This is the science used by many who recommend limiting protein to an absolute minimum, usually 20% or less.</description>

      <title>Seven important reasons not to eat wheat</title>
      <link>https://www.craigccfl.com/post/7reasons-wheat/</link>

      <description>Eating whole grain breads to improve your health and increase fiber? Maybe it is not such a great idea. If it is processed food, it probably has wheat or a wheat by-product in the ingredients. Wheat is subsidized by our government, it&amp;rsquo;s cheap and very profitable for food companies. There&amp;rsquo;s many problems stemming from wheat products, detailed in the book Grain Brain (see books category). Dr Ken Berry has hundreds of YouTube videos posted online designed to help people improve their health.</description>

      <description>Brief look at nutrition&amp;rsquo;s role versus the complications many endure when infected with COVID-19.
Mainstream news seems to agree on one thing, the death toll brought about due to COVID-19 is disproportionally affecting those with hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, smokers &amp;amp; the obese. Additional studies are noting other factors such as low vitamin D, zinc and other mineral deficiencies. On the surface, most think the metabolic disorders are related to aging in general; however, researchers and some doctors are starting to publish papers addressing the real elephant in the room, our Standard American diet (SAD).</description>

      <title>Is salting our food bad for us?</title>
      <link>https://www.craigccfl.com/tube/salt_bad/</link>

      <description>Salt is essential for life.
Our experts often advise us to restrict salt intake, based on what, faulty science? The answer to this question is yes, faulty science. Complications from insufficient salt intake are far worse than consuming excessive salt. The human body easily regulates excessive salt, with no side effects. The body cannot deal with a lack of salt in our systems. Low salt intake exacerbates insulin resistance, heart palpitations, dysfunctions in the nervous systems, headaches, increases hunger, etc.</description>

      <description>With the exception of dairy products, animal sources of food are the least inflammatory products we consume. Animal products when properly raised and prepared also contain everything we need in the most bio available forms for full absorption. Humans have eaten animals for 2M-years, long enough to develop larger brains and smaller digestive systems.
Despite these facts, it amazes me when groups like WHO and LANCET declare something we’ve been eating for 2M-years a class 2 carcinogen.</description>

      <title>Soybeans and the Brain</title>

      <description>America&amp;rsquo;s most widely consumed oil causes genetic changes in the brain. Most people think soybean oil is healthy regardless of it being highly processed. To extract oil from soybeans and other vegetables, producers use toxic chemicals. The chemicals are then removed, leaving us so called healthy unsaturated oils. Soy by itself is highly estrogenic. If you don’t know what estrogenic means, Google it. You can also look up the causes of man-boobs to learn about estorgenics.</description>

      <title>Fiber is not necessarily beneficial for health</title>
      <link>https://www.craigccfl.com/post/fiber/</link>

      <guid>https://www.craigccfl.com/post/fiber/</guid>
      <description>Carbohydrates are not a necessary nutrient for human health and fiber, both insoluble and soluble, are carbohydrates. There is no clinical data substantiating our health is dependent upon our intake of fiber. There is a clinical study in the publications section of this site discussing improved digestion when fiber is removed and Dr. Paul Saladino sums up the subject very well in the linked YouTube video.
There’s several researchers and medical doctors that are not buying into the fiber crap, (pardon the pun).</description>

      <title>Really, more fruits and vegetables?</title>
      <link>https://www.craigccfl.com/post/more-fruits-and-vegetables/</link>

      <guid>https://www.craigccfl.com/post/more-fruits-and-vegetables/</guid>
      <description>We’re consistently told, eating more fruits and vegetables reduces our risk of cardiovascular diseases. We’re also told these plant foods contain necessary antioxidants, vitamins and phytochemicals that ultimately improve our health. This guidance is solely based on observational studies, not randomized control studies. We’ll here is a control study published in the European Journal of Nutrition,
“Effect of increasing fruit and vegetable intake by dietary intervention on nutritional bio-markers and attitudes to dietary change: a randomized trial,” basically stating that increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables provides no signification health benefits or reduction in markers of disease.</description>
