        <description>Want a healthy brain when older, ditch the statins and change your diet. The Cholesterol and all-cause mortality in elderly people from the Honolulu Heart Program: a cohort study is just an association; however, the science behind Ancel Keys&amp;rsquo; saturated fat &amp;amp; cholesterol contributing to heart disease is also an association study, one that was manipulated to reveal a bias result Resources here Scientist are perplexed with the results of the Cholesterol and all-cause mortality study.</description>

        <description>Reducing saturated fats as suggested by our USDA, is very bad advice. They got it all wrong when they started promoting vegetable oils to replace saturated fats. Conventional wisdom suggests eating polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oils are healthier for our heart, despite interventional studies dating back to the 60s proving this advice is misleading. We consume more PUFAs today, yet the metabolic health of our society is rapidly declining each decade.</description>

        <description>Dr. Ken Berry, &amp;ldquo;Suffering from Dunlaps disease, follow these instructions.&amp;rdquo; What&amp;rsquo;s Dunlaps disease? It&amp;rsquo;s when the belly done lops over the belt holding up your pants. Coming to the realization this site has a lot of postings debunking mainstream nutritional guidance and not much instruction written in keep it simple (KIS) format, decided to post something different called, Simple steps for becoming fat adapted. The reason for this specific guidance is based on N=1 and what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and heard thousands of others accomplish by taking some of these steps.</description>

        <description>TMAO, no correlation to atherosclerosis. This is a technical paper for those who have delved into some of the scientific discussions regarding over activation of human growth hormone and its relationship with long-term health. The consensuses (beliefs) states over activation of metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), creates excessive cellular oxidation leading to atherosclerosis, and diets high in choline (meat) cause over activation of TMAO. This is the science used by many who recommend limiting protein to an absolute minimum, usually 20% or less.</description>

        <description>Eating whole grain breads to improve your health and increase fiber? Maybe it is not such a great idea. If it is processed food, it probably has wheat or a wheat by-product in the ingredients. Wheat is subsidized by our government, it&amp;rsquo;s cheap and very profitable for food companies. There&amp;rsquo;s many problems stemming from wheat products, detailed in the book Grain Brain (see books category). Dr Ken Berry has hundreds of YouTube videos posted online designed to help people improve their health.</description>

        <description>Do not pay attention to the recommendations of the DGAC, if you want to be healthy. We’ll another episode from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) now recommending Americans restrict their saturated fat from 10% to 7%. This flies in the face of clinical research and hundreds of thousands anecdotal studies the last 5-years definitively showing the damage excessive carbohydrates cause liver, kidney, heart and brain damage.
Think about it, we’re not good at making energy from protein, the process of converting protein to energy is highly inefficient; our protein requirement is for rebuilding tissue, not energy.</description>

        <description>Brief look at nutrition&amp;rsquo;s role in the complications many endure when infected with COVID-19. Mainstream news seems to agree on one thing, the death toll brought about due to COVID-19 is disproportionally affecting those with hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, smokers &amp;amp; the obese. Additional studies are noting other factors such as low vitamin D, zinc and other mineral deficiencies. On the surface, most think the metabolic disorders are related to aging in general; however, researchers and some doctors are starting to publish papers addressing the real elephant in the room, our Standard American diet (SAD).</description>

        <description>USDA not using acceptable scientific methodolgies for dietary recommendations. Dietary Guidelines 2015-20
The nation&amp;rsquo;s experts look at the best available science (or do they) to determine for the masses the best dietary practices for a healthy life. Their findings are found with facts, not conjecture, for they are the world&amp;rsquo;s experts. Is this how things really work? The Dietary Guideline for Americans (DGA) are all the proven facts? The decision makers in the DGA do not have any conflicts of interest, political bias, secret agendas?</description>

        <description>We lost our minds to wheat This paper, purely hypothetical, but interesting none the less, by Stanton, J (2019)., published in the Journal of Evolution and Health, titled, Voices of the Gods: How we lost our minds to agriculture, purposes to explain our addiction to wheat and the effect wheat has on our minds. To get a better grasp of the author’s theory, I’d recommend visiting the wiki pages and read a few paragraphs on the subject of bicameralism physiology, at least look it up in Merriam-Webster.</description>

        <description>Misleading CBC attack job Misleading CBC attack job portrayed as news to keep us healthy. This psychologist explains in detail that the advice given by CBC is misleading hyperbole. Research fats and find out what happens when polyunsaturated and unsaturated fats oxidize. We should not be eating the stuff.
