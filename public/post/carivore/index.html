<p>Most people end up on a carnivore diet by going through a process, they generally start out with Paleo then move to low-carb high-fat (LCHF) then many of us spend time doing the ketogenic diet. Usually, just out of curiosity, some of us move into a carnivore diet. IMO, it never hurts to try something for a couple months just to see how you feel (N=1). Eating strictly carnivore for two months is not going to cause any damage whatsoever to the body. After a couple months try different things, such as re-introducing other foods one at a time, just to see how you feel, or you can decide that you feel so good after a couple months, you don&rsquo;t want to eat other types of foods. The latter is where I ended up.</p>
<p>There are many misconceptions about eating strict carnivore diet. Most people think eating carnivore means eating only red meat, but that&rsquo;s far from the truth. Carnivore includes fish, shellfish, eggs, pork, chicken, dairy fat and anything else that comes from a living creature. Many people freak out on the idea of eating strictly carnivore because we&rsquo;re all told that beef is unhealthy. Usually the first thing that comes to mind is excessive cholesterol, saturated fats, too high protein, lack of vitamin C causing scurvy, constipation, etc. The facts, consumption of animal foods has been our basic diet for the last 3.4 million years.
We must remember that our human physiology requires zero carbohydrates, the carbohydrates that we need are produced in the liver through a process called gluconeogenesis. The body breaks down proteins &amp; fats and turns what it needs into glucose, enough glucose to meet all the biological needs. This is a healthy process for our body. We do not need carbs for fuel, our fuel sources are better when they come from fat. Must also note here that fiber both soluble and insoluble is a carbohydrate, fiber is unnecessary for human health.</p>
<p>Eating strictly carnivore, we remove toxic substances found in plant foods. Do some research on lectin, oxalate, cytotoxins, neurotoxins and the root causes of many autoimmune disorders. You&rsquo;ll find the majority of the toxins we consume come the plants that we&rsquo;re told to eat on a regular basis. And, we&rsquo;re not even touching the pesticide issues with plant foods. The consumption of plant foods may not be affecting you in a short term, or you&rsquo;ve just gotten used to consuming these plant foods and have built up a resistance or gotten used to not feeling 100%.
Try removing plants from the diet, you might be surprised how much better you feel. So much so, you may find you&rsquo;ve lost all desire for plant foods because you don&rsquo;t like feeling bloated, don&rsquo;t like being constipated, don&rsquo;t like the brain fog or generally just feel better without plants in the diet. The holy grail of food is not kale / spinach, its liver. All animal foods provide bio available nutrients, nutrients that do not need converting for absorption. This is not the case for plants. By consuming plants, we&rsquo;re basically trying to run Windows software on a Macintosh and vice a versa. Plants come from a different operating system, our digestive systems are not designed to extract nutrients from plants; in addition, much of the fiber we consume along with our plant foods is actually inhibiting us from absorbing the nutrients we need to remain healthy.</p>
<p>The primary thing about eating carnivore is it eliminates all sugar, grains, processed foods, vegetable and seed oils: All of which are detrimental to human health short &amp; long-term. I recommend anyone struggling try this out for eight weeks, they&rsquo;ll end up feeling pretty good and probably drop a few pounds, gain some muscle and lose some visceral fat. As we age our requirement for protein increases, but what do we see our elderly eating for breakfast, its not half-dozen eggs sunny side up with 8-slices of beef bacon. This is why they end up so frail with brittle bones at age 70 plus?</p>
<p>Interested in trying out carnivore for a couple months? Below you&rsquo;ll find a video from Dr. Ken Barry where he perfectly lays out 15 items that people trying out the carnivore diet can get wrong the first time around. This is great advice, its also very healthy at any age.</p>
