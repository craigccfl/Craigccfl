<h2 id="dr-ken-berry-suffering-from-dunlaps-disease-follow-these-instructions">Dr. Ken Berry, &ldquo;Suffering from Dunlaps disease, follow these instructions.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s Dunlaps disease? It&rsquo;s when the belly done lops over the belt holding up your pants. Coming to the realization this site has a lot of postings debunking mainstream nutritional guidance and not much instruction written in keep it simple (KIS) format, decided to post something different called, <em>Simple steps for becoming fat adapted</em>. The reason for this specific guidance is based on N=1 and what I&rsquo;ve seen and heard thousands of others accomplish by taking some of these steps. Best part of all, these steps do not require the purchase of anything, won&rsquo;t need to go hungry, no special supplements are needed and it does not require exhausting exercise, e.g., gym memberships: Although, that last one does help physically and mentally.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not eat sugar, any kind of sugar, no corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, galactose, maltose, etc. Best way to do this, when grocery shopping, if the items have more than one ingredient other than salt, do not purchase it. You&rsquo;ll find all these multi ingredient foods in the center isles of the store, do not enter, you only need to walk the perimeter of the store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not eat seed or vegetable oils, this includes sunflower, canola, vegetable, soy and especially anything containing hydrogenated oils. These oils oxidize easily and when that happens, the oils become toxins, creating an inflammatory immune system response internally. Even the miracle olive and coconut oils are questionable. Stick with real quality butter, ghee, tallow and bacon lard. These oils will only oxidize at very high temperatures, they&rsquo;re much safer versus polyunsaturated fats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dairy products are continually debated, some people do better than others. Milk is a no, lactose is a sugar. Cheese and other fermented dairy products like yogurt will depend on your personal tolerance. Fifty percent of the human population finds milk products inflammatory. Best way to find out if you have a problem, ditch dairy for 60-days, see how you feel: Reintroduce some dairy after 60-days, see how you feel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not eat grain products, rye, bran and especially wheat. All these grains are refined and processed, even whole grains. Sugar is sugar, the body does not differentiate sugars from processed grains. Grains will spike the insulin hormone. The insulin hormone puts the body in storage mode. We cannot burn body fat when insulin levels are high. Excessive weight is not a calorie in calorie out issue, it&rsquo;s more hormonal and always spiking insulin is the reason people struggle losing weight. Eating fat keeps insulin levels low, protein spikes insulin a little for short periods, carbs spike insulin and when combined with fiber, spike insulin for hours versus minutes. Don&rsquo;t believe this, go buy a continuous glucose meter and measure your results after eating some breakfast cereal or whole wheat bread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fruits are basically a no, one banana has 4-grams of sugar, apples are high too. The sugars in fruits are fructose, our body handles fructose very poorly. Excessive fructose develops into liver fat because we cannot deal with it. Liver disease is epidemic in our society. Fructose over load is also known as non-alcoholic liver disease, it&rsquo;s the same disease chronic alcoholics develop. If you must have some fruit, ditch the grapes and stick to blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and other low sugar fruits. Best to ditch all fruit IMO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many vegetables we need to stay away from, they&rsquo;re high in sugar and we do not need their fiber. The whole fiber recommendation is total BS. There&rsquo;s no controlled studies confirming we need to eat X-grams of fiber to prevent colon cancer. Starchy vegetables are concentrated with sugars, this include yams, sweet potatoes, potatoes and other tubers. Many so called healthy vegetables are toxic, small doses of poison that attack our thyroid, liver, brain and other organs. Vegetables are optional, if you have to eat some, stick to dark greens, but also know things like spinach and kale are loaded with oxalate, causing minor inflammatory responses, keeping our insulin spiked. If you&rsquo;re looking for vitamin A, eat some beef liver versus high carb carrots. Another item to watch with vegetables are lectins. Lectins destroy our intestinal lining membrane. Vegetables high in lectins include eggplant, tomato, jalapenos, tomatillo, all legumes and peanuts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No beer, it&rsquo;s nothing but liquid grain bread. No fruit cocktails or other sugary drinks. If you must drink, have a shot of tequila, just one serving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn how to fast 16-hours per day, keep the feasting window to 8-hours or less. This helps keep insulin levels low enough to actually burn some body fat. There is a plethora of information about how and the benefits of intermittent fasting. Do not eat anything 4-hours prior to bed time, it&rsquo;s not that difficult if you have a proper dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat till your full. We should not be hungry after finishing a meal. If you have not figured it out yet, you&rsquo;ll be eating beef, pork, eggs, fish, oysters, clams and maybe some cheese, all covered with grass fed butter, all cooked in ghee or tallow. Eat the items above and nothing else and I promise in 30-days, you&rsquo;ll shed some serious belly fat. Look at this as the way you&rsquo;ll want to eat the rest of your life. Rib eyes one night, liver and salmon the next, chuck roast to your hearts content and maybe some brisket on the weekend. Believe it or not, it does not get old. Try to have surf and turf a few nights a week, IMO there&rsquo;s lots of good nutrients and minerals found in our underwater friends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s 100s of ways to improve on this KIS method, each person is different so it is not a one size fits all. However, this is the basic information we should be getting from our medical practitioners. I must also note, the recommendations above will dramatically lower a diabetics need for insulin. Eliminate the carbs from the diet, Type 2 diabetics will need to make adjustments to their insulin dosage. Work with your doctor; just don&rsquo;t let them talk you out of eliminating the majority of carbs from your diet. Your doctor is not an expert in nutrition and most dietitians are taught the mantra in schools funded by Kellogg, Post, Coke, Pepsi, etc., see the problem here.</p>
<p>Below you&rsquo;ll find a couple videos from Dr. Ken Berry. He welcomes others to share his videos. Ken has his list of 11-steps to losing body fat, pretty much what you&rsquo;ve just read. Look up Dr. Berry&rsquo;s YouTube channel, it&rsquo;s all good advice. Ken is one of the few doctors that actually help people treat the root causes of their health problems, and the best part, his methods do not require purchasing his supplements or paying for his counseling.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
