      <description>Never skip a meal - - Right
People that know me, especially while traveling for work, mention that I eat like a snake. When I do eat, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot and when I&amp;rsquo;m not eating, it can be for a few days. This is what&amp;rsquo;s nice about being fat adapted, if there&amp;rsquo;s nothing healthy to eat, which there rarely is when traveling, it&amp;rsquo;s not a problem to skip a few meals: It&amp;rsquo;s called not being a slave to food.</description>
