      <description>Our nutritional needs have not changed. Scientist are aware of the fact, species cannot have a large digestive system and a large brain. There is only so much energy to distribute, it either goes to the brain or to the digestive system. Animals either need a large stomach and intestine to extract energy from low caloric plant foods or have an increase in intelligence from eating dense nutrient bioavailable foods usually derived from consuming animals.</description>
