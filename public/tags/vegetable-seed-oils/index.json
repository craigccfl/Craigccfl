If you\u0026rsquo;re taking medications for cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea or chronic pain, this is the video to watch.\nDr Paul Mason is a Sports Doctor who also holds degrees in Physiotherapy and Occupational Health. He is internationally recognized in the field of low carb nutrition, and utilizes it in the management of his patients, including elite athletes. The video below covers a plethora of information explaining the health damage from modern-day foods containing primarily seed oils and fructose. Want the clinical science behind keto and low carb high fat (LCHF) diets, take an hour watch and listen to the video, take notes: It\u0026rsquo;s extremely informative.\nThis is a typical office visit with a medical professional; you drop 80-plus pounds, get off your diabetes and high blood pressure medications, reduce chronic inflammation, start sleeping better and your doctor or other people ask you how you did it. Tell them LCHF, keto or carnivore and they say, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s bad and not healthy.\u0026quot; Those comments come from pure ignorance of the latest real science unadulterated by the big food industry, pharmaceuticals and government officials who are basically wrong about most things when it comes to science and health.\nThis video is geared to give the misinformed a humbling education in proper human nutrition. If you\u0026rsquo;re struggling to lose weight, control blood pressure, control diabetes, concerned about dementia, have sleep apnea, chronic inflammation, etc., Dr. Mason explains how things can improve for many in just a few days by making a few dietary changes. This information is contrary to everything taught the last 60-years; however, the science is in, the clinical test results are in, it\u0026rsquo;s just not making mainstream, for reasons mentioned in Paul\u0026rsquo;s video.\n    Paul Mason MD - \u0026ldquo;Are you smarter than your doctor?

The Cholesterol and all-cause mortality in elderly people from the Honolulu Heart Program: a cohort study is just an association; however, the science behind Ancel Keys' saturated fat \u0026amp; cholesterol contributing to heart disease is also an association study, one that was manipulated to reveal a bias result Resources here Scientist are perplexed with the results of the Cholesterol and all-cause mortality study. It shows we\u0026rsquo;ve been wrong about the role cholesterol plays in human health. And, this study also shows higher cholesterol levels are even more important as we age.\nEvery cell in our body needs cholesterol, especially our brain cells. Eighty-five percent of the cholesterol serum measured in our blood is manufactured by our liver, only a 15% contribution of cholesterol comes from the diet. In layman\u0026rsquo;s terms, cholesterol is a mixed bag, and good/bad cholesterol depends on a person\u0026rsquo;s metabolic health. High cholesterol in a metabolic healthy person is generally good, but high cholesterol in a metabolically challenged person is likely not good. It\u0026rsquo;s not HDL good and LDL bad, LDL can be good or bad depending on the density of the cholesterol particles. High density LDL is bad and is associated with arterial inflammation and thickening of arterial walls. The good less dense LDL is very beneficial to health and longevity. Our medical professionals do not do the proper blood testing to determine various densities of cholesterol particles found in the blood, it\u0026rsquo;s an expensive test not covered by standard medical insurance.\nThe combination of high triglycerides and high cholesterol is a strong indication of dense LDL particles and metabolic dysfunction. Not giving out medical advice here, but if triglycerides are in the 70 mg/dL range and cholesterol is in the high range, things are as they should be in a healthy individual. High cholesterol in a healthy person is not an indication of heart disease, a much stronger correlation to heart disease is high / chronic inflammation. Dietary contributors to high inflammation are vegetable and seed oils, sugars, starchy carbs, stress, lack of sleep, toxins found in plant foods and environmental sources. Some books, videos and resources getting much more granular on this subject can be found on this site.\nThe Cholesterol and all-cause mortality in elderly people from the\nHonolulu Heart Program: a cohort study looks at an older population over the span of 20-years.

Most people end up on a carnivore diet by going through a process, they generally start out with Paleo then move to low-carb high-fat (LCHF) then many of us spend time doing the ketogenic diet. Usually, just out of curiosity, some of us move into a carnivore diet. IMO, it never hurts to try something for a couple months just to see how you feel (N=1). Eating strictly carnivore for two months is not going to cause any damage whatsoever to the body. After a couple months try different things, such as re-introducing other foods one at a time, just to see how you feel, or you can decide that you feel so good after a couple months, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to eat other types of foods. The latter is where I ended up.\nThere are many misconceptions about eating strict carnivore diet. Most people think eating carnivore means eating only red meat, but that\u0026rsquo;s far from the truth. Carnivore includes fish, shellfish, eggs, pork, chicken, dairy fat and anything else that comes from a living creature. Many people freak out on the idea of eating strictly carnivore because we\u0026rsquo;re all told that beef is unhealthy. Usually the first thing that comes to mind is excessive cholesterol, saturated fats, too high protein, lack of vitamin C causing scurvy, constipation, etc. The facts, consumption of animal foods has been our basic diet for the last 3.4 million years.\nWe must remember that our human physiology requires zero carbohydrates, the carbohydrates that we need are produced in the liver through a process called gluconeogenesis. The body breaks down proteins \u0026amp; fats and turns what it needs into glucose, enough glucose to meet all the biological needs. This is a healthy process for our body. We do not need carbs for fuel, our fuel sources are better when they come from fat. Must also note here that fiber both soluble and insoluble is a carbohydrate, fiber is unnecessary for human health.\nEating strictly carnivore, we remove toxic substances found in plant foods. Do some research on lectin, oxalate, cytotoxins, neurotoxins and the root causes of many autoimmune disorders. You\u0026rsquo;ll find the majority of the toxins we consume come the plants that we\u0026rsquo;re told to eat on a regular basis. And, we\u0026rsquo;re not even touching the pesticide issues with plant foods. The consumption of plant foods may not be affecting you in a short term, or you\u0026rsquo;ve just gotten used to consuming these plant foods and have built up a resistance or gotten used to not feeling 100%.\nTry removing plants from the diet, you might be surprised how much better you feel. So much so, you may find you\u0026rsquo;ve lost all desire for plant foods because you don\u0026rsquo;t like feeling bloated, don\u0026rsquo;t like being constipated, don\u0026rsquo;t like the brain fog or generally just feel better without plants in the diet. The holy grail of food is not kale / spinach, its liver. All animal foods provide bio available nutrients, nutrients that do not need converting for absorption. This is not the case for plants. By consuming plants, we\u0026rsquo;re basically trying to run Windows software on a Macintosh and vice a versa. Plants come from a different operating system, our digestive systems are not designed to extract nutrients from plants; in addition, much of the fiber we consume along with our plant foods is actually inhibiting us from absorbing the nutrients we need to remain healthy.\nThe primary thing about eating carnivore is it eliminates all sugar, grains, processed foods, vegetable and seed oils: All of which are detrimental to human health short \u0026amp; long-term. I recommend anyone struggling try this out for eight weeks, they\u0026rsquo;ll end up feeling pretty good and probably drop a few pounds, gain some muscle and lose some visceral fat. As we age our requirement for protein increases, but what do we see our elderly eating for breakfast, its not half-dozen eggs sunny side up with 8-slices of beef bacon. This is why they end up so frail with brittle bones at age 70 plus?\nInterested in trying out carnivore for a couple months? Below you\u0026rsquo;ll find a video from Dr. Ken Barry where he perfectly lays out 15 items that people trying out the carnivore diet can get wrong the first time around. This is great advice, its also very healthy at any age.\n    Dr Ken Berry MD\n  ","description":"Eating carnivore explained","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["Carnivore","Red Meat"],"title":"Carnivore Eating","uri":"https://craigccfl.com/posts/carivore/"},{"content":"  Reducing saturated fats as suggested by our USDA, is very bad advice. They got it all wrong when they started promoting vegetable oils to replace saturated fats. Conventional wisdom suggests eating polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oils are healthier for our heart, despite interventional studies dating back to the 60s proving this advice is misleading. We consume more PUFAs today, yet the metabolic health of our society is rapidly declining each decade. This post contains a paper detailing, only 1 in 8 people are metabolically healthy. This means 88% of us have one or more metabolic diseases caused by our diets. If you\u0026rsquo;re following our standard dietary guidelines (SAD), it is almost an absolute guarantee, you\u0026rsquo;re one of the 88%.\n(See the attached posting below from the University of North Carolina)\nPrevalence of Optimal Metabolic Health\nOur population is eating less beef than ever before. The consumption of chicken since the 70s has increased 3-fold, where the consumption of pork is about the same. We do all this because the experts tell us saturated fat causes heart disease. Could it be many of the vegetable and seed oils are in fact causing our diseases? IMO, the use of vegetable and seed oils seems to correlate well with the prevalence of modern day epidemics. The video below posted by Dr. Saladino is long, but the information provided, though granular makes a very good case for avoiding chicken and pork, and why we should focus more on beef. The video featuring Dr. Saladino explains the problems with conventional chicken and pork.\nAlso take note of Dr. Ken Berry\u0026rsquo;s video where Ken does a great job of explaining the benefits of eating saturated fat.\n    Dr Paul Saladino \u0026amp; Nina Telchotz\n     Dr Ken Berry\n ","description":"We're getting some bad advice.","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["Oxidized Oils","Vegetable \u0026 Seed Oils"],"title":"Is eating chicken healthy?","uri":"https://craigccfl.com/posts/reducingfats/"},{"content":"  Dr. Ken Berry, \u0026ldquo;Suffering from Dunlaps disease, follow these instructions.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s Dunlaps disease? It\u0026rsquo;s when the belly done lops over the belt holding up your pants. Coming to the realization this site has a lot of postings debunking mainstream nutritional guidance and not much instruction written in keep it simple (KIS) format, decided to post something different called, Simple steps for becoming fat adapted. The reason for this specific guidance is based on N=1 and what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen and heard thousands of others accomplish by taking some of these steps. Best part of all, these steps do not require the purchase of anything, won\u0026rsquo;t need to go hungry, no special supplements are needed and it does not require exhausting exercise, e.g., gym memberships: Although, that last one does help physically and mentally.\n  Do not eat sugar, any kind of sugar, no corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, galactose, maltose, etc. Best way to do this, when grocery shopping, if the items have more than one ingredient other than salt, do not purchase it. You\u0026rsquo;ll find all these multi ingredient foods in the center isles of the store, do not enter, you only need to walk the perimeter of the store.\n  Do not eat seed or vegetable oils, this includes sunflower, canola, vegetable, soy and especially anything containing hydrogenated oils. These oils oxidize easily and when that happens, the oils become toxins, creating an inflammatory immune system response internally. Even the miracle olive and coconut oils are questionable. Stick with real quality butter, ghee, tallow and bacon lard. These oils will only oxidize at very high temperatures, they\u0026rsquo;re much safer versus polyunsaturated fats.\n  Dairy products are continually debated, some people do better than others. Milk is a no, lactose is a sugar. Cheese and other fermented dairy products like yogurt will depend on your personal tolerance. Fifty percent of the human population finds milk products inflammatory. Best way to find out if you have a problem, ditch dairy for 60-days, see how you feel: Reintroduce some dairy after 60-days, see how you feel.\n  Do not eat grain products, rye, bran and especially wheat. All these grains are refined and processed, even whole grains. Sugar is sugar, the body does not differentiate sugars from processed grains. Grains will spike the insulin hormone. The insulin hormone puts the body in storage mode. We cannot burn body fat when insulin levels are high. Excessive weight is not a calorie in calorie out issue, it\u0026rsquo;s more hormonal and always spiking insulin is the reason people struggle losing weight. Eating fat keeps insulin levels low, protein spikes insulin a little for short periods, carbs spike insulin and when combined with fiber, spike insulin for hours versus minutes. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe this, go buy a continuous glucose meter and measure your results after eating some breakfast cereal or whole wheat bread.\n  Fruits are basically a no, one banana has 4-grams of sugar, apples are high too. The sugars in fruits are fructose, our body handles fructose very poorly. Excessive fructose develops into liver fat because we cannot deal with it. Liver disease is epidemic in our society. Fructose over load is also known as non-alcoholic liver disease, it\u0026rsquo;s the same disease chronic alcoholics develop. If you must have some fruit, ditch the grapes and stick to blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and other low sugar fruits. Best to ditch all fruit IMO.\n  Many vegetables we need to stay away from, they\u0026rsquo;re high in sugar and we do not need their fiber. The whole fiber recommendation is total BS. There\u0026rsquo;s no controlled studies confirming we need to eat X-grams of fiber to prevent colon cancer. Starchy vegetables are concentrated with sugars, this include yams, sweet potatoes, potatoes and other tubers. Many so called healthy vegetables are toxic, small doses of poison that attack our thyroid, liver, brain and other organs. Vegetables are optional, if you have to eat some, stick to dark greens, but also know things like spinach and kale are loaded with oxalate, causing minor inflammatory responses, keeping our insulin spiked. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for vitamin A, eat some beef liver versus high carb carrots. Another item to watch with vegetables are lectins. Lectins destroy our intestinal lining membrane. Vegetables high in lectins include eggplant, tomato, jalapenos, tomatillo, all legumes and peanuts.\n  No beer, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing but liquid grain bread. No fruit cocktails or other sugary drinks. If you must drink, have a shot of tequila, just one serving.\n  Learn how to fast 16-hours per day, keep the feasting window to 8-hours or less. This helps keep insulin levels low enough to actually burn some body fat. There is a plethora of information about how and the benefits of intermittent fasting. Do not eat anything 4-hours prior to bed time, it\u0026rsquo;s not that difficult if you have a proper dinner.\n  Eat till your full. We should not be hungry after finishing a meal. If you have not figured it out yet, you\u0026rsquo;ll be eating beef, pork, eggs, fish, oysters, clams and maybe some cheese, all covered with grass fed butter, all cooked in ghee or tallow. Eat the items above and nothing else and I promise in 30-days, you\u0026rsquo;ll shed some serious belly fat. Look at this as the way you\u0026rsquo;ll want to eat the rest of your life. Rib eyes one night, liver and salmon the next, chuck roast to your hearts content and maybe some brisket on the weekend. Believe it or not, it does not get old. Try to have surf and turf a few nights a week, IMO there\u0026rsquo;s lots of good nutrients and minerals found in our underwater friends.\n  There\u0026rsquo;s 100s of ways to improve on this KIS method, each person is different so it is not a one size fits all. However, this is the basic information we should be getting from our medical practitioners. I must also note, the recommendations above will dramatically lower a diabetics need for insulin. Eliminate the carbs from the diet, Type 2 diabetics will need to make adjustments to their insulin dosage. Work with your doctor; just don\u0026rsquo;t let them talk you out of eliminating the majority of carbs from your diet. Your doctor is not an expert in nutrition and most dietitians are taught the mantra in schools funded by Kellogg, Post, Coke, Pepsi, etc., see the problem here.\nBelow you\u0026rsquo;ll find a couple videos from Dr. Ken Berry. He welcomes others to share his videos. Ken has his list of 11-steps to losing body fat, pretty much what you\u0026rsquo;ve just read. Look up Dr. Berry\u0026rsquo;s YouTube channel, it\u0026rsquo;s all good advice. Ken is one of the few doctors that actually help people treat the root causes of their health problems, and the best part, his methods do not require purchasing his supplements or paying for his counseling.\nEnjoy!\n    Dr Ken Berry\n     Dr Ken Berry\n     Diet Doctor\n ","description":"KIS Rules","id":4,"section":"posts","tags":["Burn body fat","Simple Steps"],"title":"Learn how to burn fat, keeping it simple (KIS)","uri":"https://craigccfl.com/posts/kis/"},{"content":"Our nutritional needs have not changed. Scientist are aware of the fact, species cannot have a large digestive system and a large brain. There is only so much energy to distribute, it either goes to the brain or to the digestive system. Animals either need a large stomach and intestine to extract energy from low caloric plant foods or have an increase in intelligence from eating dense nutrient bio-available foods usually derived from consuming animals. An example, gorillas versus humans, gorillas eat primarily plants, they grow large and they\u0026rsquo;re strong they eat from sunrise to sunset, not leaving much time for anything but eating. Their digestive track is 3-times larger as compared to the human digestive track. Their stomach is much larger than their shoulder width. Humans on the other hand have wide shoulders, small waist and much larger brain. We evolved this way primarily due to changes in our diet, taking place some estimate 3.4 million years ago.\nDue to necessity in the wake of food shortages caused from lack of wild game, humans learned to grow and store grains, dating back to at least 10K-years ago. We are able to derive energy from grown plant foods and we\u0026rsquo;re able to sustain, but this comes at a cost. For one, our skulls have shrunk, decreasing brain capacity ten percent. This is the reason many people have their wisdom teeth pulled, to prevent over crowding of the teeth. Along with agriculture we\u0026rsquo;ll find the development of chronic disease like diabetes, mental disorders, arthritis and other degenerative maladies. This is something the soy and plant based proponents conveniently seem to over look when pushing their misguided agenda in their dietary recommendations. We should not need insulin to control hyperglycemia, take pain pills to live with arthritis or blood pressure drugs for hypertension, all of which can be fixed with proper human nutrition, fat and protein. Yes, eat that fibrous food, it\u0026rsquo;s completely natural for us to digest massive quantities for low caloric fibrous plant foods and have massive bowl movements. The logical alternative for us as humans is to eat foods that offer the most bio-available nutrients we need to keep strong.\nThough we can only theorize what human life was like 3.4M-years ago, scientist are finding evidence we ate a diet consisting of other animals. We are one of the few species on the planet that pursue and kill animals mush larger in size. The fat and protein from these animals are the main reason for the growth of our cerebral expansion, till the time of agriculture becoming a main staple of our diet. Below is a link to just one article backing up the comments in this post, authored by Richard Kemeny Fat, not meat, may have led to bigger hominin brains, 28 Mar 2019. It\u0026rsquo;s time to reclaim our health, ditch the soy, processed grains, processed vegetable oil and focus on nutritious foods like quality animal based foods, including fish and for some, dairy. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with tallow, butter and fatty meats. It is the very thing we need to keep our brains strong and healthy.

This is what\u0026rsquo;s nice about being fat adapted, if there\u0026rsquo;s nothing healthy to eat, which there rarely is when traveling, it\u0026rsquo;s not a problem to skip meals: I immensely enjoy not being a slave to food.

No need for a nap after a high carb lunch.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I\u0026rsquo;m not eating while skipping meals, what\u0026rsquo;s actually happening is my energy needs are utilizing stored fat. The average lean human carries 100k calories of fat fuel every where they go. At 2,500 calories/day that\u0026rsquo;s 40-days without needing to re-feed before the body starts cannibalizing itself, aka starvation. Starvation is not the same as fasting and the two are distinctly different.\nThe current fasting record is over 365-days under medical supervision. Granted, this gentleman was well over 400lbs and he had much more than the 100k calories carried by a lean human. With a little salt and water, fasting for 5-days, once fat adapted is easy, just takes some regular practice. Having this skill is absolutely liberating and it is very healthy. Our ancestors did not eat 5-squares a day.\nWhile fasting, the body makes new autoimmune cells, destroys and rebuilds damaged cells, makes new T-cells and increases growth hormones to protect against muscle loss. Imagine that, people pay big bucks for a growth hormones and it\u0026rsquo;s available for free. Read up on the subject of autophagy and fasting.

Dietary Guidelines 2015-20\nThe nation\u0026rsquo;s experts look at the best available science (or do they) to determine for the masses the best dietary practices for a healthy life. Their findings are found with facts, not conjecture, for they are the world\u0026rsquo;s experts. Is this how things really work? The Dietary Guideline for Americans (DGA) are all the proven facts? The decision makers in the DGA do not have any conflicts of interest, political bias, secret agendas?

Meanwhile, we\u0026rsquo;ve watched mental disorders increase, waistlines expand, type 2 diabetes explode, cases of hypertension increase, heart disease not improve since the 60s with the exception of better medical procedures, preemptive detection and treatments; all the while, we have 100-times more gyms, people are moving more and for the most part, people are following the DGA recommendations. Obesity was not a problem in the 50s, as compared to 2020, especially among teenagers.\nCould it be that our dietary recommendations are making the public health worse? Are we living longer due to the DGA advice or is it just improvements in pharmaceuticals and medical practices keeping us clinging to life longer? Is our quality of life improving or getting worse as a result of the DGA? Stealing a line from a previous cartoon posted on twitter, \u0026ldquo;We should not laugh at those that believe in Santa Clause when so many still believe in the USDA Dietary Guidelines.\u0026quot;\nNina Teicholz is a welcomed force trying to bring some common sense to our nutritional experts. The book, Big Fat Surprise, authored by Nina Teicholz is a must read to fully understand the flaws made by our nutritional experts when weak epidemiology science is used to make definitive correlations that they wrap in the guise of scientific fact. The latest round of DGA (2020) recommendations continues to not heed the recommendations of good scientific practices: They are not stopped from giving the public awful nutritional advice; advice that cannot be proven in clinical studies. Often, the DGA recommendation are dis-proven in clinical studies, clinical studies they continue to ignore when moving forward their recommendations.

To get a better grasp of the author’s theory, I’d recommend visiting the wiki pages and read a few paragraphs on the subject of bicameralism physiology, at least look it up in Merriam-Webster. If you’re really interested in bicameralism physiology there’s a good book written by Julian Jaynes (1976) The Origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind. Factoid, bicameralism is the basic structure of the government our founding fathers built for the United States, US Senate and the House of Representatives.\nThere’s a few smart doctors linking mental disorders e.g., schizophrenia, bi-polar, paranoia, etc., to autoimmune deficiencies and chronic inflammation. Mental diseases the last 50-years are increasing throughout the population each decade too epidemic proportions; this includes dementia, Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s, etc. Most of the public just accepts this trend as a problem of modern day society. General medical practitioners are primarily focused on medicinal chemical treatment to force reactions in the brain while a handful of good doctors are promoting a whole body approach focused on low inflammatory ancestral nutrition. These good doctors have helped thousands of people, many people are helping themselves, just by avoiding inflammatory foods. There’s a plethora of Facebook sites dedicated to LCHF, keto and carnivore lifestyles where we can find thousands of people healing their disorders, both medial and physical.\nIts been almost 2-years since I had a beer (liquid loaf of whole wheat bread).

Animal products when properly raised and prepared also contain everything we need in the most bio available forms for full absorption. Humans have eaten animals for 2M-years, long enough to develop larger brains and smaller digestive systems.\nDespite these facts, it amazes me when groups like WHO and LANCET declare something we’ve been eating for 2M-years a class 2 carcinogen. They use epidemiology to make absurd correlations and when the epidemiology contradicts their personal biases, they always conveniently ignore the study. Gary Taubes wrote a great book, “Bad Science;,” where he illustrates perfectly the political and personal bias of our intellectual health experts.\nBack to this study, we’ll find a controlled interventional human study where one group increases their consumption of red meat while the control group increase consumption of plant based products. Conclusion, the group eating animal products (not exclusively) had better oxidative stress markers as compared to the control group. The results most likely would have been significantly better if the animal based group ate pure carnivore. There is not a single interventional clinical study showing that consuming meat has negative consequences too humans. If you find one, please send it to me.\nWe always have the experts telling us to limit animal protein to 20% of our total consumption, this is bad advice, especially if you’re 40-plus. As we age, our requirement for protein increases. Increased protein helps us maintain muscle and the trace minerals help keep our bones dense. Keeps our glucose levels lower and it is easier on our digestive systems.

If you don’t know what estrogenic means, Google it. You can also look up the causes of man-boobs to learn about estorgenics.\nThe misguided nutritional advice the last 50-years has promoted canola, vegetable, corn and soybean oils to replace saturated fats like butter. All unsaturated oil easily oxidize, making them toxic for human consumption. IMO, these oils should all be removed for our store shelves until they’re proven safe, but that won’t happen for two reasons, big agricultural lobbyists and our government nutritionist would have to admit their advice has caused the current epidemic of metabolic dysfunction.\nSoybean oil is in everything, fast food is fried in it, restaurants cook our vegetables in it, they replace real butter with soybean margarine, soy oil is in store baked goods, frozen foods, etc. Some studies are linking these oils to our current epidemic of skin cancers.

Carbohydrates are not a necessary nutrient for human health and fiber, both insoluble and soluble, are carbohydrates. There is no clinical data substantiating our health is dependent upon our intake of fiber.

Often, when I try to explain my current eating preferences, I get the whack-a-doodle look along with the typical audacious comments regarding cholesterol, vitamins, scurvy, fiber, constipation, etc., hence, the purpose of this website.\nI’ve been questioning conventional nutritional wisdom for several years because it is not working for people. Obesity, diabetes, mental disorders are all on the rise. Doctors and hospitals are great if you get hit by a bus, but when it comes to chronic disease, their only weapons are surgery and a prescription pad. There’s another weapon available the doctors rarely, if ever consider, it’s called proper ancestral human nutrition, and what most people “think” is proper nutrition, is making most everyone physically and mentally worse off.\nMy personal journey kicked off around 2009, while focusing on my MBA degree in my late 40s, not paying much attention to lifestyle, I was diagnosed pre-diabetic (T2D) and given the typical prescription and handouts from the American Diabetes Association (ADA). My doctor at the time stated there was no hope for normality, going forward, best we could do is manage the disease. Finding the ADA information completely lacking substance and full of awful advice, my journey to learn everything I could about diet and health got focused.\n(Note: By the time a person is diagnosed pre-diabetec, at least 10-years of liver, pancreas, kidney, heart and brain damage has already occurred.)\nAdopting typical whole foods, limiting fat to 20%, daily gym routine, the weight came off and the glucose numbers dropped, things were great and my doctor was impressed. Things worked great until I injured my my shoulder. Afterwards, the weight came back and the glucose numbers increased. The limited fat diet and daily exercise routine is unsustainable, even for the motivated.\nNext journey was learning everything possible about Paleo diets. For many, this is a great lifestyle; however, with 20-plus years of metabolic damage, Paleo for me needed refinement, which was Low Carb High Fat (LCHF). Losing weight with LCHF was effortless, 75lbs. in 12-months. Glucose from 270mg/dl highs to 120mg/dl, all without meds; however, I was still looking to normalize fasting glucose \u0026lt; 100mg/dl. It’s not easy reversing 20-plus years of metabolic abuse caused by the Standard American Diet (SAD). I say abuse and this is with a lifetime of restricting sugar and eating home cooked whole foods. All my life I have listened to the standard mantra of our mainstream health gurus, and it did not prevent development of T2D. The 60% carbs, 20% protein, 20% fat macro ratios are not the ancestral norms for human physiology. Wish I new this in my 30s.\nCurrently, I am still working to normalize fasting glucose numbers, they are getting better overtime. I’m sure a little more heavy lifting exercise and sunlight will do the trick. I’m 99.5% carnivore, fasting is a regular routine and very convenient while traveling across the country for work, my mind is always clear and focused, stress levels very low and I always feel great. Because I still drink coffee (a plant), I say 99.5% carnivorous. I feel and function better today than I did 20-years ago, and I love the freedom of not being a food slave. Maintaing a healthy weight has never been easier.\nWe have choices, I’ve made my lifetime choice and I share this information with people I care about plus others that want to learn. Those that took some time to learn the science, the real science of human nutrition, have seen their lives transformed for the better. So the next time I get the look, whack-a-doodle, I say, do your homework, question conventional nutritional wisdom and see for yourself (N=1).
