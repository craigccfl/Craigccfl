      <description>Reducing saturated fats as suggested by our USDA, is very bad advice. They got it all wrong when they started promoting vegetable oils to replace saturated fats. Conventional wisdom suggests eating polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oils are healthier for our heart, despite interventional studies dating back to the 60s proving this advice is misleading. We consume more PUFAs today, yet the metabolic health of our society is rapidly declining each decade.</description>
