__Dr. Paul Mason__

This is one of the best videos explaining cholesterol. Our medical professionals are perpetuating incorrect information propagated in the late 1950s by Ancel Keys who used selective world epidemiology studies to encourage the low fat diet. Cholesterol does not clog arteries, stating this is the equivalent of stating _fireman start fires._
