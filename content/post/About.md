My personal nutritional paradigm shifted completely counter intuitive to almost every nutritional mantra taught the last 60-years due to the people, books, videos, podcasts and published studies found on this site. Often, when I try to explain my current eating preferences, I get the whack-a-doodle look along with the typical audacious comments regarding cholesterol, vitamins, scurvy, fiber, constipation, etc., hence, the purpose of this website.


I’ve been questioning conventional nutritional wisdom for several years because it is not working for people. Obesity, diabetes, mental disorders are all on the rise. Doctors and hospitals are great if you get hit by a bus, but when it comes to chronic disease, their only weapons are surgery and a prescription pad. There’s another weapon available the doctors rarely, if ever consider, it’s called proper ancestral human nutrition, and what most people “think” is proper nutrition, is making most everyone physically and mentally worse off.


My personal journey kicked off around 2009, while focusing on my MBA degree in my late 40s, not paying much attention to lifestyle, I was diagnosed pre-diabetic (T2D) and given the typical prescription and handouts from the American Diabetes Association (ADA). My doctor at the time stated there was no hope for normality, going forward, best we could do is manage the disease. Finding the ADA information completely lacking substance and full of awful advice, my journey to learn everything I could about diet and health got focused.

*(Note: By the time a person is diagnosed pre-diabetec, at least 10-years of liver, pancreas, kidney, heart and brain damage has already occurred.)*


Adopting typical whole foods, limiting fat to 20%, daily gym routine, the weight came off and the glucose numbers dropped, things were great and my doctor was impressed. Things worked great until I injured my my shoulder. Afterwards, the weight came back and the glucose numbers increased. The limited fat diet and daily exercise routine is unsustainable, even for the motivated.


Next journey was learning everything possible about Paleo diets. For many, this is a great lifestyle; however, with 20-plus years of metabolic damage, Paleo for me needed refinement, which was Low Carb High Fat (LCHF). Losing weight with LCHF was effortless, 75lbs. in 12-months. Glucose from 270mg/dl highs to 120mg/dl, all without meds; however, I was still looking to normalize fasting glucose < 100mg/dl. It’s not easy reversing 20-plus years of metabolic abuse caused by the Standard American Diet (SAD). I say abuse and this is with a lifetime of restricting sugar and eating home cooked whole foods. All my life I have listened to the standard mantra of our mainstream health gurus, and it did not prevent development of T2D. The 60% carbs, 20% protein, 20% fat macro ratios are not the ancestral norms for human physiology. Wish I new this in my 30s.


Currently, I am still working to normalize fasting glucose numbers, they are getting better overtime. I’m sure a little more heavy lifting exercise and sunlight will do the trick. I’m 99.5% carnivore, fasting is a regular routine and very convenient while traveling across the country for work, my mind is always clear and focused, stress levels very low and I always feel great. Because I still drink coffee *(a plant)*, I say 99.5% carnivorous. I feel and function better today than I did 20-years ago, and I love the freedom of not being a food slave. Maintaing a healthy weight has never been easier.


We have choices, I’ve made my lifetime choice and I share this information with people I care about plus others that want to learn. Those that took some time to learn the science, the real science of human nutrition, have seen their lives transformed for the better. So the next time I get the look, whack-a-doodle, I say, do your homework, question conventional nutritional wisdom and see for yourself (N=1). A good place to start is www.craigccfl.com


Enjoy!
