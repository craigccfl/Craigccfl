With the exception of dairy products, animal sources of food are the least inflammatory products we consume. Animal products when properly raised and prepared also contain everything we need in the most bio available forms for full absorption. Humans have eaten animals for 2M-years, long enough to develop larger brains and smaller digestive systems.

Despite these facts, it amazes me when groups like WHO and LANCET declare something we’ve been eating for 2M-years a class 2 carcinogen. They use epidemiology to make absurd correlations and when the epidemiology contradicts their personal biases, they always conveniently ignore the study. Gary Taubes wrote a great book, “Bad Science;,” where he illustrates perfectly the political and personal bias of our intellectual health experts.

Back to this study, we’ll find a controlled interventional human study where one group increases their consumption of red meat while the control group increase consumption of plant based products. Conclusion, the group eating animal products (not exclusively) had better oxidative stress markers as compared to the control group. The results most likely would have been significantly better if the animal based group ate pure carnivore. There is not a single interventional clinical study showing that consuming  meat has negative consequences too humans. If you find one, please send it to me.

We always have the experts telling us to limit animal protein to 20% of our total consumption, this is bad advice, especially if you’re 40-plus. As we age, our requirement for protein increases. Increased protein helps us maintain muscle and the trace minerals help keep our bones dense. Keeps our glucose levels lower and it is easier on our digestive systems. Red meat is the perfect food, and we should never shy away from indulging in it often.
