This paper, purely hypothetical, but interesting none the less, by Stanton, J (2019).,  published in the Journal of Evolution and Health, titled, __Voices of the Gods: How we lost our minds to agriculture__, purposes to explain our addiction to wheat and the effect wheat has on our minds. To get a better grasp of the author’s theory, I’d recommend visiting the wiki pages and read a few paragraphs on the subject of bicameralism physiology, at least look it up in Merriam-Webster. If you’re really interested in bicameralism physiology there’s a good book written by Julian Jaynes (1976) __The Origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind__. Factoid, bicameralism is the basic structure of the government our founding fathers built for the United States, US Senate and the House of Representatives.


There’s a few smart doctors linking mental disorders e.g., schizophrenia, bi-polar, paranoia, etc., to autoimmune deficiencies and chronic inflammation. Mental diseases the last 50-years are increasing throughout the population each decade too epidemic proportions; this includes dementia, Alzheimer's, etc. Most of the public just accepts this trend as a problem of modern day society. General medical practitioners are primarily focused on medicinal chemical treatment to force reactions in the brain while a handful of good doctors are promoting a whole body approach focused on low inflammatory ancestral nutrition. These good doctors have helped thousands of people, many people are helping themselves, just by avoiding inflammatory foods. There’s a plethora of Facebook sites dedicated to LCHF, keto and carnivore lifestyles where we can find thousands of people healing their disorders, both medial and physical.   

Its been almost 2-years since I had a beer (liquid loaf of whole wheat bread). Should the desire to have a drink get the best of me one day, it will be some quality tequila and salt.

Enjoy the document, I did (It’s short).
