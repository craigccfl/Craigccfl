## Reducing saturated fats as suggested by our USDA, is very bad advice.

They got it all wrong when they started promoting vegetable oils to replace saturated fats. Conventional wisdom suggests eating polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oils are healthier for our heart, despite interventional studies dating back to the 60s proving this advice is misleading. We consume more PUFAs today, yet the metabolic health of our society is rapidly declining each decade. This post contains a paper detailing, only 1 in 8 people are metabolically healthy. This means 88% of us have one or more metabolic diseases caused by our diets. If you're following our standard dietary guidelines (SAD), it is almost an absolute guarantee, you're one of the 88%. 
(See the attached posting below from the University of North Carolina)

[Prevalence of Optimal Metabolic Health](https://craigccfl.com/media/Prevalence_Optimal_Metabolic_Health.pdf)

Our population is eating less beef than ever before. The consumption of chicken since the 70s has increased 3-fold, where the consumption of pork is about the same. We do all this because the experts tell us saturated fat causes heart disease. Could it be many of the vegetable and seed oils are in fact causing our diseases? IMO, the use of vegetable and seed oils seems to correlate well with the prevalence of modern day epidemics. The video below posted by Dr. Saladino is long, but the information provided, though granular makes a very good case for avoiding chicken and pork, and why we should focus more on beef. The video featuring Dr. Saladino explains the problems with conventional chicken and pork. 

Also take note of Dr. Ken Berry's video where Ken does a great job of explaining the benefits of eating saturated fat.
