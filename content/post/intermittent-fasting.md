__Never skip a meal - - Right__

People that know me, especially while traveling for work, mention that I eat like a snake. When I do eat, it's a lot and when I'm not eating, it can be for a few days. This is what's nice about being fat adapted, if there's nothing healthy to eat, which there rarely is when traveling, it's not a problem to skip a few meals: It's called not being a slave to food. At any given time, there's 100K calories on me that go where ever I go and after a certain amount of time without refeeding, I'm now eating some healthy fat and destroying damaged cells, aka autophagy (look it up).

A nice little publication form the *Journal of Proteomics* April 2020 explains the healthy association between body markers known to prevent cancer, being found with healthy subjects that practice regular fasting.
