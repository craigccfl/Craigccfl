This is a technical paper for those who have delved into some of the scientific discussions regarding over activation of human growth hormone and its relationship with long-term health. The consensuses (beliefs) states over activation of metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), creates excessive cellular oxidation leading to atherosclerosis, and diets high in choline (meat) cause over activation of TMAO. This is the science used by many who recommend limiting protein to an absolute minimum, usually 20% or less.  

Many people have already figured out anecdotally, high protein macro ratios improve satiety without negative side effects. Higher protein diets improve weight loss, if that is a goal and high protein macro ratios improve many other positive health markers. Carnivore macro ratios generally run 40 to 60 percent protein with the balance being primarily saturated fat. Many promoting keto macro ratios recommend 20 percent protein to 80 percent saturated fats with some carbs. Both diets are good for metabolic health; however, determining which is best depends on your current state of metabolic health and how fat adapted you are at the cellular level. There’s lots of information available online to make this determination for yourself.

Back to the paper, as the title suggests, ***Plasma Levels of TMAO can be Increased with ‘Healthy’ and ‘Unhealthy’ Diets
and Do Not Correlate with the Extent of Atherosclerosis but with Plaque Instability*** confirming what many of us have learned via N=1. This is a good study for debunking the meat causes cancer and heart disease myths, despite it being a little granular with the details.

Enjoy!
