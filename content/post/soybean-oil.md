America's most widely consumed oil causes genetic changes in the brain.
Most people think soybean oil is healthy regardless of it being highly processed. To extract oil from soybeans and other vegetables, producers use toxic chemicals. The chemicals are then removed, leaving us so called healthy unsaturated oils. Soy by itself is highly estrogenic. If you don’t know what estrogenic means, Google it. You can also look up the causes of man-boobs to learn about estorgenics.

The misguided nutritional advice the last 50-years has promoted canola, vegetable, corn and soybean oils to replace saturated fats like butter. All unsaturated oil easily oxidize, making them toxic for human consumption. IMO, these oils should all be removed for our store shelves until they’re proven safe, but that won’t happen for two reasons, big agricultural lobbyists and our government nutritionist would have to admit their advice has caused the current epidemic of metabolic dysfunction.

Soybean oil is in everything, fast food is fried in it, restaurants cook our vegetables in it, they replace real butter with soybean margarine, soy oil is in store baked goods, frozen foods, etc. Some studies are linking these oils to our current epidemic of skin cancers. We are what we eat, we eat oxidized oils, we grow sick skin cells and increase inflammation leading to other metabolic diseases.
