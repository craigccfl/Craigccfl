## Our nutritional needs have not changed.

Scientist are aware of the fact, species cannot have a large digestive system and a large brain. There is only so much energy to distribute, it either goes to the brain or to the digestive system. Animals either need a large stomach and intestine to extract energy from low caloric plant foods or have an increase in intelligence from eating dense nutrient bioavailable foods usually derived from consuming animals. An example, gorillas versus humans, gorillas eat primarily plants, they grow large and they're strong they eat from sunrise to sunset, not leaving much time for anything but eating. Their digestive track is 3-times larger as compared to the human digestive track. Their stomach is much larger than their shoulder width. Humans on the other hand have wide shoulders, small waist and much larger brain. We evolved this way primarily due to changes in our diet, taking place some estimate 3.4 million years ago.  

Due to necessity in the wake of food shortages caused from lack of wild
game, humans learned to grow and store grains, dating back to at least 10K-years
ago. We are able to derive energy from grown plant foods and we're able to
sustain, but this comes at a cost. For one, our skulls have shrunk, decreasing
brain capacity ten percent. This is the reason many people have their wisdom
teeth pulled, to prevent over crowding of the teeth. Along with agriculture we'll find the
development of chronic disease like diabetes, mental disorders, arthritis and
other degenerative maladies. This is something the soy and plant based proponents conveniently seem to over look when pushing their misguided agenda in their dietary recommendations. We should not need insulin to control hyperglycemia, take pain pills to live with arthritis or blood pressure drugs for hypertension, all of which can be fixed with proper human nutrition, fat and protein. Yes, eat that fibrous food, it's completely natural for us to digest massive quantities for low caloric fibrous plant foods and have massive bowl movements. The logical alternative for us as humans is to eat foods that offer the most bioavailable nutrients we need to keep strong.

Though we can only theorize what human life was like 3.4M-years ago, scientist are finding evidence we ate a diet consisting of other animals. We are one of the few species on the planet that pursue and kill animals mush larger in size. The fat and protein from these animals are the main reason for the growth of our cerebral expansion, till the time of agriculture becoming a main staple of our diet. Below is a link to just one article backing up the comments in this post, authored by Richard Kemeny *Fat, not meat, may have led to bigger hominin brains*, 28 Mar 2019. It's time to reclaim our health, ditch the soy, processed grains, processed vegetable oil and focus on nutritious foods like quality animal based foods, including fish and for some, dairy. There's nothing wrong with tallow, butter and fatty meats. It is the very thing we need to keep our brains strong and healthy. Sorry vegans, history shows we were and are **Apex Carnivores** and trying to make us anything but, is costing society their health and wellness.

Enjoy
