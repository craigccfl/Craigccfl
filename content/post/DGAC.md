We’ll another episode from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) now recommending Americans restrict their saturated fat from 10% to 7%. This flies in the face of clinical research and hundreds of thousands anecdotal studies the last 5-years definitively showing the damage excessive carbohydrates cause liver, kidney, heart and brain damage.

Think about it, we’re not good at making energy from protein, the process of converting protein to energy is highly inefficient; our protein requirement is  for rebuilding tissue, not energy. Humans get their energy from fats or carbohydrates: Polyunsaturated fats oxidize, becoming highly toxic to our cells, causing excessive inflammation, saturated fats are a much better source of low inflammation energy. The DGAC is recommending we consume oxidized fat sources, restricting saturated fats, leaving the bulk of our energy requirements coming from carbohydrates. Never in the 2-million year history of humans have we consumed the bulk of our energy from carbohydrates, never.
