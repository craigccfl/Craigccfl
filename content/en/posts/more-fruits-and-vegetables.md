#### More fruits and vegetables really improve health?

We’re consistently told, eating more fruits and vegetables reduces our risk of cardiovascular diseases. We’re also told these plant foods contain necessary antioxidants, vitamins and phytochemicals that ultimately improve our health. This guidance is solely based on observational studies, not randomized control studies. We’ll here is a control study published in the European Journal of Nutrition,


“Effect of increasing fruit and vegetable intake by dietary intervention on nutritional bio-markers and attitudes to dietary change: a randomized trial,” basically stating that increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables provides no signification health benefits or reduction in markers of disease.


[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6060837/)


Eur J Nutr. 2018; 57(5): 1855–1872.

Published online 2017 May 30. doi: 10.1007/s00394-017-1469-0


This information is counter intuitive to the majority of information provided by our nutritional experts that often tout the importance and benefits of increasing vitamin C, polyphenols and other phytonutrient consumption.


So, we can live in ignorance, believing in historically bad observational science or we can take a half hour and mine through this attached study and actually learn whether or not, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is actually beneficial to our health long-term.
