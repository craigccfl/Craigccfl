#### Salt is essential for life.

Our experts often advise us to restrict salt intake, based on what, faulty science? The answer to this question is yes, faulty science. Complications from insufficient salt intake are far worse than consuming excessive salt. The human body easily regulates excessive salt, with no side effects. The body cannot deal with a lack of salt in our systems. Low salt intake exacerbates insulin resistance, heart palpitations, dysfunctions in the nervous systems, headaches, increases hunger, etc.

Dr. James DiNicolantonio	author of *The Salt Fix,* does a great job in his book exposing the bad science and politics behind the crusade against salt. Dr. DiNicolantonio points out, we need 10 to 15 grams of salt / day, maybe more depending on our environment and physical activity. The two videos below dive into the salt subject, one with Dr. Berry and Dr. DiNicolantonio and another with Dr. Fung. The conclusion, both videos explain, __Low salt diet recommendations are never warranted.__ The benefit gained in reduced blood pressure, is not worth the risk of depleting the body of essential sodium.
