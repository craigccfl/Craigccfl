### Want a healthy brain when older, ditch the statins and change your diet.

The *Cholesterol and all-cause mortality in elderly people from the Honolulu Heart Program: a cohort study* is just an association; however, the science behind Ancel Keys' saturated fat & cholesterol contributing to heart disease is also an association study, one that was manipulated to reveal a bias result [Resources here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/records-found-in-dusty-basement-undermine-decades-of-dietary-advice/) Scientist are perplexed with the results of the *Cholesterol and all-cause mortality study.* It shows we've been wrong about the role cholesterol plays in human health. And, this study also shows higher cholesterol levels are even more important as we age.

Every cell in our body needs cholesterol, especially our brain cells. Eighty-five percent of the cholesterol serum measured in our blood is manufactured by our liver, only a 15% contribution of cholesterol comes from the diet. In layman's terms, cholesterol is a mixed bag, and good/bad cholesterol depends on a person's metabolic health. High cholesterol in a metabolic healthy person is generally good, but high cholesterol in a metabolically challenged person is likely not good. It's not HDL good and LDL bad, LDL can be good or bad depending on the density of the cholesterol particles. High density LDL is bad and is associated with arterial inflammation and thickening of arterial walls. The good less dense LDL is very beneficial to health and longevity. Our medical professionals do not do the proper blood testing to determine various densities of cholesterol particles found in the blood, it's an expensive test not covered by standard medical insurance.

The combination of high triglycerides and high cholesterol is a strong indication of dense LDL particles and metabolic dysfunction. Not giving out medical advice here, but if triglycerides are in the 70 mg/dL range and cholesterol is in the high range, things are as they should be in a healthy individual. High cholesterol in a healthy person is not an indication of heart disease, a much stronger correlation to heart disease is high / chronic inflammation. Dietary contributors to high inflammation are vegetable and seed oils, sugars, starchy carbs, stress, lack of sleep, toxins found in plant foods and environmental sources. Some books, videos and resources getting much more granular on this subject can be found on this site.

The *Cholesterol and all-cause mortality in elderly people from the
Honolulu Heart Program: a cohort study* looks at an older population over the span of 20-years. This is a free publication from the LANCET Publishing Group, but you'll have to sign up to a free account to download the whole study. This process is worth the effort and costs nothing. Unfortunately there's restrictions on this publication that prevent me from posting a direct link to a pdf file.
