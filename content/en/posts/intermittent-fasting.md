### Never skip a meal - - Right?

People that know me, especially while traveling for work, mention that I eat like a snake. When I do eat, it's a lot and when I'm not eating, it's for several days. This is what's nice about being fat adapted, if there's nothing healthy to eat, which there rarely is when traveling, it's not a problem to skip meals: I immensely enjoy not being a slave to food. The freedom of not needing to eat every few hours keeps me focused, alert and more productive. No need for a nap after a high carb lunch.

It's not that I'm not eating while skipping meals, what's actually happening is my energy needs are utilizing stored fat. The average lean human carries 100k calories of fat fuel every where they go. At 2,500 calories/day that's 40-days without needing to re-feed before the body starts cannibalizing itself, aka starvation. Starvation is not the same as fasting and the two are distinctly different.

The current fasting record is over 365-days under medical supervision. Granted, this gentleman was well over 400lbs and he had much more than the 100k calories carried by a lean human. With a little salt and water, fasting for 5-days, once fat adapted is easy, just takes some regular practice. Having this skill is absolutely liberating and it is very healthy. Our ancestors did not eat 5-squares a day.   

While fasting, the body makes new autoimmune cells, destroys and rebuilds damaged cells, makes new T-cells and increases growth hormones to protect against muscle loss.  Imagine that, people pay big bucks for a growth hormones and it's available for free. Read up on the subject of autophagy and fasting. Try to think of one main stream religion in the world that does not practice some form of regular fasting. Pluto, Socrates, Jesus, Mohammad, Buddhists and Hindus all preach the benefits of fasting. The paper and videos below elaborate with some of the latest science.

A nice little publication form the *Journal of Proteomics* April 2020 explains the healthy association between body markers known to prevent cancer, being found with healthy subjects that practice regular fasting.
