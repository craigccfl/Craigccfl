#### USDA not using acceptable scientific methodolgies for dietary recommendations.

![](/images/DGA.png)

*Dietary Guidelines 2015-20*

The nation's experts look at the best available science (or do they) to determine for the masses the best dietary practices for a healthy life. Their findings are found with facts, not conjecture, for they are the world's experts. Is this how things really work? The Dietary Guideline for Americans (DGA) are all the proven facts? The decision makers in the DGA do not have any conflicts of interest, political bias, secret agendas? Well, if this is what you believe then please explore the writings of Nina Teicholz's recent paper *Rejecting recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences.*

__DGA recommendations / day__

All of the above sounds reasonable, we've had this information for 7-decades. Meanwhile, we've watched mental disorders increase, waistlines expand, type 2 diabetes explode, cases of hypertension increase, heart disease not improve since the 60s with the exception of better medical procedures, preemptive detection and treatments; all the while, we have 100-times more gyms, people are moving more and for the most part, people are following the DGA recommendations. Obesity was not a problem in the 50s, as compared to 2020, especially among teenagers.

Could it be that our dietary recommendations are making the public health worse? Are we living longer due to the DGA advice or is it just improvements in pharmaceuticals and medical practices keeping us clinging to life longer? Is our quality of life improving or getting worse as a result of the DGA? Stealing a line from a previous cartoon posted on twitter, __"We should not laugh at those that believe in Santa Clause when so many still believe in the USDA Dietary Guidelines."__

Nina Teicholz is a welcomed force trying to bring some common sense to our nutritional experts. The book, __Big Fat Surprise__, authored by Nina Teicholz is a must read to fully understand the flaws made by our nutritional experts when weak epidemiology science is used to make definitive correlations that they wrap in the guise of scientific fact. The latest round of DGA (2020) recommendations continues to not heed the recommendations of good scientific practices: They are not stopped from giving the public awful nutritional advice; advice that cannot be proven in clinical studies. Often, the DGA  recommendation are dis-proven in clinical studies, clinical studies they continue to ignore when moving forward their recommendations. In the following link, please see just how bad our experts manipulate science and ignore the practices required by their profession.
