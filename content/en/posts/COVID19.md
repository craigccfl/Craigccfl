#### Brief look at nutrition's role in the complications many endure when infected with COVID-19.

Mainstream news seems to agree on one thing, the death toll brought about due to COVID-19 is disproportionally affecting those with hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, smokers & the obese. Additional studies are noting other factors such as low vitamin D, zinc and other mineral deficiencies. On the surface, most think the metabolic disorders are related to aging in general; however, researchers and some doctors are starting to publish papers addressing the real elephant in the room, our *Standard American diet* (SAD).

A disproportionate number of adults 40-years and older require medications for blood pressure, blood sugar and inflammation, medications that treat symptoms, not root causes. Now we're fighting a virus that seems to create havoc for those with high blood sugar and syndrome X. A glucose reading of 60-80 is about the equivalent of a teaspoon of sugar circulating through our system (normal), a banana is the equivalent of 4-teaspoons of sugar. Now add some whole grain cereal/cereal bar, milk sugar lactose and maybe a pastry. See where this is heading. Watching the news, doctors and nurses taking break from the havoc in New York City, they're exhausted and sitting in a room, catching a bite, I was shocked. The only foods they had in the room, pizza, Subway sandwiches, Krispy Cream donuts, cookies, sodas and fruits. God bless these people and thank you for your sacrifice, but what the Hell. This neglect of proper human nutrition is a big problem in this country, the world for that matter.      

Below are some papers and videos. My hope is we as a society, human beings, start addressing the elephant in the room. Doing so, being at our best metabolically, just might help us prepare for the next viruses already brewing in some remote area.
