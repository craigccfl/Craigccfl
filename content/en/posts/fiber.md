#### Fiber is not necessary for good health; in fact, fiber can be detrimental to health.

Carbohydrates are not a necessary nutrient for human health and fiber, both insoluble and soluble, are carbohydrates. There is no clinical data substantiating our health is dependent upon our intake of fiber. There is a clinical study in the publications section of this site discussing improved digestion when fiber is removed and Dr. Paul Saladino sums up the subject very well in the linked YouTube video.


There’s several researchers and medical doctors that are not buying into the fiber crap, (pardon the pun). They’re hard to find because search engines keep them obscure to perpetuate the fiber myth. There’s an abundance of grain in this country, more than we can eat, government and industry want us consuming this food, negatively affecting our health. They put it in our processed foods, it’s cheap, the profits are good and we grow too much of it due to subsidies. Think a farmer ever got a government subsidy for growing broccoli? I rest my case.


Try going without fiber for 30-days, see how you feel. You’ll probably have fewer movements during the week, but one thing for sure, you will not be constipated. Much more to follow on this subject; because, the fiber myth is so entrenched in our belief system, most people will not discuss or accept facts contradicting the fiber myth. Watch the two videos below.
