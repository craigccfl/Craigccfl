__If you're a health care professional treating patients with metabolic syndrome, this is the video to watch. If you're taking medications for cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea or chronic  pain, this is the video to watch.__

Dr Paul Mason is a Sports Doctor who also holds degrees in Physiotherapy and Occupational Health. He is internationally recognized in the field of low carb nutrition, and utilizes it in the management of his patients, including elite athletes. The video below covers a plethora of information explaining the health damage from modern-day foods containing primarily seed oils and fructose. Want the clinical science behind keto and low carb high fat (LCHF) diets, take an hour watch and listen to the video, take notes: It's extremely informative.

This is a typical office visit with a medical professional; you drop 80-plus pounds, get off your diabetes and high blood pressure medications, reduce chronic inflammation, start sleeping better and your doctor or other people ask you how you did it. Tell them LCHF, keto or carnivore and they say, ***"That's bad and not healthy."*** Those comments come from pure ignorance of the latest real science unadulterated by the big food industry, pharmaceuticals and government officials who are basically wrong about most things when it comes to science and health.

This video is geared to give the misinformed a humbling education in proper human nutrition. If you're struggling to lose weight, control blood pressure, control diabetes, concerned about dementia, have sleep apnea, chronic inflammation, etc., Dr. Mason explains how things can improve for many in just a few days by making a few dietary changes. This information is contrary to everything taught the last 60-years; however, the science is in, the clinical test results are in, it's just not making mainstream, for reasons mentioned in Paul's video.
